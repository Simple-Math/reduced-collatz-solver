# Reduced Collatz Solver
We present an explicit algorithmic realization of the reduced Collatz map, based on finite macro-jump functions, that exit all nontrivial residue traps.
The construction refines the classical accelerated Collatz dynamics by partitioning the integers into residue-based cycles and providing algebraically bounded exit maps for each cycle.
While not yielding a closed-form solution to the Collatz conjecture, this work gives a concrete executable framework, consistent with parity-vector theory and known valuation bounds.
